    <h2>Brian Crews</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Brian Crews and I live in Fremont, CA with my wife and two boys. My older daughter is currently serving a mission in Toronto, Canada. </p>
    <p>My hobbies and interests are numerous; I love to learn new things. Artistic or creative activities, and computer programming were my first. For a while I was really interested in outdoors activities like backpacking and camping. Most recently I earned my first Amateur Radio license.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m working towards an Applied Technology BS through the BYU Pathway program. I am taking this course primarily as a refresher while I wait for my transcripts to come through.  I have some limited and very outdated experience developing web sites through my previous education and through past employment. I am looking forward to seeing if and how things have changed and hopefully make my current skills more relevant.</p>
    <p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and always have been.  I have enormous respect for people who join the church later in their lives and consciously make the often difficult choice to do so.</p>
