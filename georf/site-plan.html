      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Everywhere you go, there are countless radio waves, whizzing by, carrying payloads of information: AM and FM broadcasts, emergency communications or just families using hand held radios. Wouldn’t you like to see where all the interesting things are happening on the radio waves in your area?   As a web developer, I intend to make a website where you can do that.  Visitors to the site will be able to look up frequencies or bands of frequencies and see them on a visual representation of the electromagnetic spectrum. If relevant geographic information, such as an address or coordinate is available, it will be displayed on a map. This site will be different from existing sites because of it’s strong emphasis on a visual and intuitive representation of radio frequencies and their transmitters, with a mouse driven user interface.  This project will only be a mock-up of the functionality and visual style of the site, without an elaborate back-end server or database.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This web site is designed to be used by moderately technical users who are familiar with radios and the rf spectrum. Users will use the site if they are currious about what frequencies are being used around them and perhaps listen in.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Everywhere you go, there are countless radio waves, whizzing by, carrying payloads of information: AM and FM broadcasts, emergency communications or just families using hand held radios. Wouldn’t you like to see where all the interesting things are happening on the radio waves in your area? GeoRF has all the information you need to become familiar with the EM spectrum and the tools to find where you can find interesting things and perhaps even listen in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electromagnetic energy is emitted as waves that radiate outward from their source like a sphere. Imagine the wave in three dimensions as a white ping pong ball with a radius that grows bigger and bigger at the speed of light. Now imagine a new black ball that grows in the same way from the same point. Repeat this over and over and at an extremely high frequency and it’s a good way to imagine how electromagnetic waves work.  The white balls would represent peaks in the intensity of the electromagnetic energy and the black balls represent that same energy, but of the opposite polarity.  Opposite polarity means the waves exert influence in an opposite direction. The speed at which successive waves are emitted determine their frequency.  Frequency might sound familiar; When you listen to the radio, you tune in a frequency. Radio frequencies are an example of EM waves. There are many other ranges or bands of EM frequencies: Radio, x-ray, gamma-rays and light are all names for bands of EM wave frequencies. The radio waves that allow you to listen to the radio and the light from the sun are the same phenomenon.

      </ul>
      <h3>Bands/FCC</h3>
      <p>
        There are a limited number of useful radio frequencies available. The Federal Communications Commission or FCC has the job or regulating and partitioning the various segments or bands of frequencies for specific uses. There are large bands such as HF, VHF, UHF and so on, that describe very loosely where a radio frequency lies.  Then there are smaller bands within these larger bands that are dedicated for specific uses. Some of these are the AM and FM broadcast bands, ISM(Industrial, Scientific and Medical) bands and the various Amateur Radio bands.  Within a band there are usually specific frequencies that are dedicated to very specific use.  For example, 467.6125mhz is assigned as channel 10 on the GMRS/FRS(General Mobile Radio Service/Family Radio Service) band, is limited to an output of 0.5 watts and a bandwidth of 11khz.  If you listened to this frequency, there’s a good chance you would hear families communicating while camping or on a road trip. You would also likely hear one of the younger family members repeatedly sending obnoxious call tones to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        GeoRF is a convenient way to visualize how all of these bands and frequencies fit into the greater spectrum of RF frequencies. Enter a search for a frequency or a station you know about, and it will show up on the frequency display along with other common frequencies nearby. Zoom out and you can see the result in relation to larger bands of frequencies. It’s enlightening to see how much is going on.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Transmitters</h3>
      <p>
        While a GMRS/FRS radio is almost always mobile, some radio transmissions and frequencies are associated with transmitters at specific locations.  In amateur radio, there are many dedicated frequencies for devices called repeaters.  These are used by licensed operators and allows them to extend their reach. Similarly, various government agencies have elaborate radio networks to enable them to efficiently communicate.  When a police officer calls for backup, it likely will go to a nearby transceiver, get routed through a wired network, and get re-transmitted at a much more distant location.  In an urban location, there could be hundreds of transmitters at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you search for a frequency on GeoRF, it might also show you approximately where it is located. This can be handy in helping you know if you can reach it with whatever radio equipment you might have. Many radio enthusiasts use small USB dongles called SDRs(Software Defined Radio) to view and listen to a wide range or transmissions.  Others use radio scanners to listen to municipal communications from police, medical and fire services.
